File Organization Automation Project

Welcome to the File Organization Automation Project! This repository contains a Python script designed to streamline the process of organizing files on your system. Whether you're dealing with a cluttered downloads folder or managing project files, this script can help you automatically sort and move files into designated folders based on their file types. The script scans a specified directory, identifies files by their extensions, and relocates them to appropriate subdirectories such as Documents, Images, Videos, Music, and more. This project is perfect for anyone looking to keep their files neatly organized without the hassle of manual sorting. Simply customize the script to fit your specific needs, and enjoy a tidy and organized file system with minimal effort.
